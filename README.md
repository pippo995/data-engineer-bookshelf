# Data Engineering Bookshelf

A curated collection of books and resources for learning computer science fundamentals and specializing in data engineering.

## Introduction

This repository represents my personal journey transitioning into data engineering. Coming from a general programming background, I realized that becoming a proficient data engineer requires both strong computer science fundamentals and specialized knowledge of data systems.

The books in this collection have been carefully selected based on recommendations from experienced professionals, online courses, and my own research. Some I've completed, others I'm currently reading, and a few are in my queue. I've organized them in a logical progression that builds knowledge from foundational concepts to specialized data engineering skills.

My criteria for including a book are:
1. Relevance to modern data engineering practices
2. Timelessness of the concepts covered
3. Depth and clarity of explanations
4. Practical applicability of the knowledge

I'm sharing this resource to help others on a similar path and to create a reference for my own learning journey. Feel free to suggest additions or share your experiences with these materials!
